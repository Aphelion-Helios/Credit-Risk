# Credit-Risk Analysis 

Risk managers will typically collect data on the loan borrowers. The data will usually be in a tabular format, with each row providing details of the borrower, including their income, total loans outstanding, and a few other metrics.

There will also be a column indicating if the borrower has previously defaulted on a loan. We will use this data to build a model that, given details for any loan described above, will predict the probability that the borrower will default (also known as PD: the probability of default). The provided data will be used to train a function that will estimate the probability of default for a borrower. Assuming a recovery rate of 10%, this can be used to give the expected loss on a loan.


We will produce a function that can take in the properties of a loan and output the expected loss.

Viable techniques to explore in accordance to this task can range from a simple regression or a decision tree to something more advanced. It would also be effiecient to use multiple methods and provide a comparative analysis.
